I  detest being told to join a Discord server when I have a question that could be easily answered by a documentation page or a proper issue tracker. So I made some axioms:

---

1. Discord isn't documentation.
2. Discord isn't change logging.
3. Discord isn't issue tracking.

---

Use a publicly accessible, search indexed, platform for these things; never a hidden members-only platform.

To me Discord's like IRC with a pretty GUI and voice channels. It's nice for conversation and chatting but really not suited for record keeping. The moment a conversation turns to something that should be properly recorded for future reference, it should be moved somewhere that's possible. And that isn't possible in Discord.
