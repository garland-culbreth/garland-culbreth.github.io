# My background

I graduated in 2021 with a PhD in theoretical physics from the University of North Texas, where I studied complex systems, nonlinear dynamics, and stochastic processes. I built a computational model of echo chamber formation on social networks undergoing  information diffusion coupled with reinforcment learning dynamics; investigating formation conditions and disruption strategies. I've also built agent-based models and studied swarm intelligence. My expertise is in applying the theory of complex systems, sochastic processes, nonlinear dynamics, and reinforcement learning to real-world problems by building numerical software, reinforcment learning models, and simulations.

# My experience

Since 2021 I've worked at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, developing and applying [DisMod-AT](https://github.com/bradbell/dismod_at), the next generation of disease modeling software for the Global Burden of Disease project. There, I've contributed to cutting-edge global estimates of disease by developing and integrating analytics software run on terabyte-scale data pipelines, producing data visualizations for presenting crucial results to senior leadership and key stakeholders, and published articles in top-tier journals, such as _The Lancet_. I developed, integrated, and maintained a first of its kind automated quality assurance pipeline, now used by all organizational levels, to ensure that global disease estimates are consistently achieving world-leading accuracy, rigor, and explainability. I've also developed documentation and guidance for junior researchers, including producing and giving organization-wide trainings in-person and asynchronously.

# My programming

I'm proficient in several programming languages, including 6 years of experience with Python, 4 with R, 4 with SQL, and 1 with Rust. I maintain several open-source Python packages for simulating complex systems and time-series analysis techniques.

# My interests

My research interests focus on complex systems and stochastic processes, building numerical and simulation modeling software and reinforcement learning models, and applying them to answer real-world questions that defy simplification.
